0.47 2016-12-13 pjacklam

0.46 2016-12-11 pjacklam

 * Fix Makefile.PL so that this module installs over the core version.

0.45 2016-12-03 pjacklam

 * Use ExtUtils::MakeMaker rather than Module::Install in Makefile.PL

 * Remove INSTALL file. The information is in the README file.

 * Improve documentation in BUGS and SUPPORT sections in POD in bignum.pm,
   bigint.pm, and bigrat.pm.

   distributions.

0.44 2016-11-15 pjacklam

 * Update bundled Module::Install from version 1.16 to version 1.17.

 * Replace function calls with method calls.

 * Include patch for CPAN RT #116506.

0.43 2016-07-09 pjacklam

 * Replace function calls with method calls.

0.42 2016-01-05 pjacklam

 * "use strict" and "use warnings" everywhere.

 * Reformat some if the code according to the "perlstyle" man page. It makes
   the code easier for read, for me at least.

 * Reorder CHANGES to chronological order.

 * Use bpi() as a class method, not a function.

 * Replace "use vars ..." with "our ...".

 * More descriptive variable names.

   these. We want to be compatible. Add tests to "infnan.inc".

0.41 2015-09-25 pjacklam

 * hex() and oct() now have the same semantics as the corresponding core
   functions. E.g., hex("cat") returns 202 and a warning "Illegal hexadecimal

 * fix #27059: t/option_l.t fails

 * on Perl 5.9.4 or later: "overload" hex() and oct() with lexical routines
   that also handle arbitrary big integers

   routines that work with big integers

 * make bignum.pm and bigrat.pm re-use code from bigint.pm

 * add exportable bpi() and bexp() methods
