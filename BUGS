Known bugs:

* The testsuite fails when Math::BigIn::Lite v0.04 is installed. This is a
  problem of Lite, not bignum. Expect Lite to be fixed soon ;)

* perl -Mbignum=t -le 'print 2.0' prints

 Loading Math::BigInt::Trace
 MBI import Math::BigInt::Trace :constant upgrade Math::BigFloat::Trace lib Calc
 Loading Math::BigFloat::Trace
 MBF import Math::BigFloat::Trace :constant downgrade Math::BigInt::Trace
 MBI new '2' => '2' (Math::BigInt::Trace)
 MBF new '2.0' => '2' (Math::BigInt::Trace)
 2 

The order of MBI and MBF is reversed, since the output is done *after* the new,
but the new of MBF downgrades internally to MBI. No solution yet.

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
